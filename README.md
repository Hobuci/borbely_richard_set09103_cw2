Advanced Web Tech Module @ Edinburgh Napier University

Heroku Hosted link: http://webshop-cukorkaland.herokuapp.com

Task: The objective is to demonstrate your understanding of server-side web development and mastery of
the Python Flask micro-framework. You will achieve this by completing a personal project in which
you design, implement, and evaluate a web application on a topic of your choice.
This is a personal project so the web-app that you will build for this second coursework is completely
up to you. However it is advisable to discuss your idea with the module leader in advance to ensure that
it has sufficient scope to enable you to achieve a decent grade. Some ideas for suitable projects include
a simple Twitter clone or a Bookmarking/URL shortening web-app. You should carefully consider the
nature of the problem domain, and design a URL hierarchy and user interface that provides your users
with a good experience. You should also research similar web-apps that you can use as a benchmark
against which to measure the functionality of your own.
